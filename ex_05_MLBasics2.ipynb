        "\n",
        "**Practical Example.** Lets clarify this with a concrete example: Here we'll assume that $y \\in \\{ \\mathrm{healthy}, \\mathrm{sick} \\}$ is a random discrete variable that tells us if a person has actually caught a certain disease. Additionally, $x \\in \\{ \\mathrm{negative}, \\mathrm{positive} \\}$ is the outcome of a test that is supposed to detect that disease. By looking at population statistics we can see that only about 1 in 1000 people will actually ever catch this disease in their life. Therefore, we know that $p(y=\\mathrm{sick}) = 1 / 1000 = 0.001$ and likewise $p(y=\\mathrm{healthy}) = 1 - p(y=\\mathrm{sick}) = 0.999$. Additionally, through clinical tests we may also know the overall probability of a test being positive or negative $p(x)$ and the *sensitivity* of the test $p(x=\\mathrm{positive}|y=\\mathrm{sick})$, which is the probability of the test showing a positive result when a person actually has the disease. All of this information can then be used to determine the conditional probability $p(y=\\mathrm{sick}|x=\\mathrm{positive})$, for example, of having the disease when the test result is positive. Interestingly, $p(y=\\mathrm{healthy}|x=\\mathrm{positive})$ often times turns out to be higher than intuitively expected - especially for rare diseases. This is because for really rare diseases the term $p(y=\\mathrm{healthy})$ is so high that a possible test would need an incredibly high sensitivity to compensate for this.\n",

        "\n",
        "**The purpose of exams.** Students generally go to university to learn. Each lecture is designed to teach students about some specific aspect of a subject area (physics, chemistry, computer science etc.). In this process, each course has a specific set of learning goals about certain topics that students should be familiar with after completing the course. So there exists an abstract set of qualifications that a student should obtain by taking each course. At the end of each course there is an exam which is supposed to test whether a student sufficiently obtained these qualifications. However, the definition of these qualifications may be complex and it is easy to imagine that there can be a rift between these true qualifications and what an exam is able to test in a limited amount of time. For example, it is likely easy to recall some fellow student which managed to pass a certain exam even with a *shaky* understanding of the topic. There might also be the opposite case of students failing the exam even though they seemed to have a good grasp of the topic. Ultimately, one can say that the outcome of an exam is not always perfectly aligned with the knowledge that a person has actually acquired.\n",
        "\n",
        "**A case study.** While Prof. Friederich is grading the ML4Nat exam one day, he wonders how effective his own exam is at judging whether or not a student has actually acquired all the necessary qualifications from his lecture.

The second discrete random variable $x = \\{ \\mathrm{pass}, \\mathrm{fail} \\}$ captures whether a student has passed the exam or failed it. To answer the initial question we therefore have to calculate the probability\n",
